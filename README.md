This repository contains my progress and portfolio as I work my way through The Odin Project's web development curriculum.


# Overview

The Odin Project is a free, open-source curriculum for learning web development. In this repository, I am documenting my journey through the curriculum, including the projects I complete and the skills I learn.

# Learning Goals

My primarily goal is to acquire as much knowledge as I can, and share it with you !
Sharing is a great opportunity for me to showcase my progress, but also to get feedback, create discussions and improve.

# Curriculum Progress

So far, I have completed the following sections of The Odin Project curriculum ( Full stack javascript path ):

- Introduction to Web Developement
- Foundations
- Intermediate HTML and CSS
- Javascript ( *Currently at the react section...* )

I have also completed several additional projects, that you can find in this repo.

# Future Plans
In the future, I plan to continue working through The Odin Project curriculum and building my portfolio of projects. I also want to expand my knowledge by learning new technologies, and further develop my skills in web development.
